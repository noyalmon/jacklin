# search anything üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: nothing special


### Team Members

### Project Description
a search bot

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are constantly searching... for meaning, for love, for that one YouTube video they saw in 2013 with a cat playing a keyboard.
But tragically, there‚Äôs never been a search bar that proudly admits it does absolutely nothing.

We saw this gaping hole in the market and knew something had to be done. Immediately. Or eventually.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing: SearchAnything‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì a revolutionary search experience where you type literally anything, hit "Search", and are met with...
‚ú® A polite, spinning wheel of construction. ‚ú®

It doesn‚Äôt search. It doesn‚Äôt judge.
It just exists ‚Äî like most startup MVPs.

Coming never. Or maybe someday. Who knows.


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
Languages used: HTML (the OG), CSS (for the vibes), JavaScript (for the illusion of functionality)

Frameworks used: Our raw courage (no frameworks were harmed in the making of this app)

Libraries used: None ‚Äî we like our code like we like our coffee: black and unfiltered ‚òï

Tools used:

üõ†Ô∏è VS Code (because dark mode makes us feel productive)

üß† Stack Overflow (copilot for life)

üé® Coolors (for dangerously average color choices)

üêå Time (mostly spent overthinking the button hover color)
